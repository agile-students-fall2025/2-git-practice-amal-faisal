## Why it interested me
I find “Software Projects Don’t Have to Be Late and Costly” interesting because it breaks a stereotype I’ve always heard about software, that projects almost always go wrong. Even from the outside, it’s common to hear stories about apps launching late, systems full of bugs, or teams struggling to meet expectations. What stood out to me in this article is the idea that those problems aren’t inevitable, and that with the right approach, software projects can actually run smoothly and deliver real value. I like this perspective because it makes the field feel less chaotic and more hopeful, showing that challenges can be managed with better planning and collaboration. For someone like me, who hasn’t worked in software but is curious about how it shapes so much of our world, it’s encouraging to see that success in these projects isn’t just luck, it’s something that can be built intentionally.

### Haroon's comment
Wow, what a find! I really appreciate the perspective this article offers. It shows that software projects don’t have to be doomed to be late or buggy; careful planning, collaboration, and proper processes can make a huge difference. It makes me feel more optimistic about working in software in the future, because it emphasizes that success is achievable with intentional effort rather than just luck.
